# Geospatial Exploratory Data Analysis for Mineral Exploration

This repository contains Python code examples and explanations for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a mineral exploration context, with a focus on geospatial data and insights. The goal is to support decision-making in identifying mineral-rich zones and optimizing exploration strategies.

## Overview

In mineral exploration projects, data from various sources, such as geophysical surveys, satellite imagery, and drill holes, is analyzed to gain insights into potential mineralization. This repository covers the key steps involved in processing and analyzing such data using Python libraries like Pandas, GeoPandas, and Matplotlib.

## Steps for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
We start by collecting geospatial and tabular data from various sources (CSV, Shapefiles, etc.). The data is cleaned to handle missing values and ensure it's ready for analysis.

- **Libraries Used**: `Pandas`, `GeoPandas`
- **Key Operations**:
  - Remove missing or duplicated entries.
  - Load geospatial data (shapefiles, drill hole data, etc.).
  
```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd

# Load data
drill_data = pd.read_csv('drill_holes.csv')
geospatial_data = gpd.read_file('mineral_zones.shp')

# Clean data
drill_data.dropna(inplace=True)
